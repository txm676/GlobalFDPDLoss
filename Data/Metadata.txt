##allSp_phylo
Island endemism status, IUCN Red List classification, generation length and extinction status information
for all species (extant and extinct), following the BirdTree taxonomy.

species = Binomial name (BirdTree taxonomy)
species_BirdLife = Birdlife binomial name
Extant = Lists the species as either extant or extinct. 
ExtinctionPeriod = Groups the species as either Current, EX_Other or EX_IUCN:
		*Current = extant species
		*EX_IUCN = species classified as extinct by the IUCN
		*EX_Other = all other extinct species
ExtinctionType = Groups the species as either Current, EX_A, EX_U, EX_IUCN:
		*EX_U = Non-IUCN extinctions of unknown cause
		*EX_A = Non-IUCN anthropogenic extinctions.
		*IUCN = species classified as extinct by the IUCN (all anthropogenic)

IslandEndemic = Identifies if the species is an island endemic. Binary (Yes/No).
IUCN = IUCN red list designation. One of LC (least concern), NT (near threatened), VU (vulnerable), EN (endangered), CR (critically endangered), or DD (data deficient). 
GenLength = Generation length.
IslandEndemic2 = island endemism status based on the seabird sensitivity analysis.

##AVONET_BIRDLIFE
Trait data for extant species from the published AVONET dataset, following the Birdlife taxonomy.
See Tobias et al. 2022 for details.
Tobias, J. A., Sheard, C., Pigot, A. L., Devenish, A. J., Yang, J., Sayol, F., ... & Schleuning, M. (2022). AVONET: morphological, ecological and geographical data for all birds. Ecology Letters, 25(3), 581-597.

##ExtinctImputedTraits_Averages
Trait data for extinct species, as well as island endemic classifications, extinction time period and 
location data, for all extinct species.
species = Binomial name (roughly following BirdLife taxonom)
Genus = Genus
Family = Family
Order = Order 
Jetz_Order = Order following the BirdTree taxonomy. Format is all capitilised. 
Jetz_Family = Family following the BirdTree taxonomy.

Beak.Length_Culmen, Beak.Length_Nares, Beak.Width, Beak.Depth, Tarsus.Length, Wing.Length, Kipps.Distance, 
Tail.Length (all mm), and Mass (g) match the traits in AVONET for extinct species (see above).
ExtinctionType =  As for the allSp_phylo dataset (described above), with the addition of:
		EW = extinct in the wild
ExtinctionPeriod = As for the allSp_phylo dataset (described above), with the addition of EW. 
ExtinctionPeriodMAP = The same as ExtinctionPeriod but has an extra category (EX_POST1500) for the 19 EX_Other species that are post-1500
		      extinctions but not currently recognised by the IUCN. Is just used to make the map in Figure 1.
IslandEndemic = As for the allSp_phylo dataset.
Isl_group_map = Groups the species into island groups or continental groups for mapping (i.e., Figure 1).
LAT = Latitude of the island or continental group. 
LON = Longitude of the island or continental group. 
Isl_group_map2 = Either NA, i.e., the species is present on no other continental or island group, or groups the species into a second group.
LAT2 = If applicable, the latitude of the second island or continental group.
LON2 = If applicable, the latitude of the second island or continental group.
Isl_group_map3 = Either NA, i.e., the species is present on only one or two continental or island group(s), or groups the species into a third group.
LAT3 = If applicable, the latitude of the third island or continental group.
LON3 = If applicable, the latitude of the third island or continental group.

##dendro_all (.RData file)
The dendrogram (built using neighbour joining) with all extant and extinct species (Birdlife taxonomy). An object of class 'phylo'.

##future.rds
The future extinction simulation data (.rds). A list with six elements (each corresponding to a specific taxonomy and species subset), each a list of 
100 elements (from 100 individual simulations) storing the extant species names selected to go extinct:
[1] "Birdlife_all"  "Birdlife_isl" 
[3] "Birdtree_all"  "Birdtree_isl" 
[5] "Birdlife_isl2" "Birdtree_isl2"
all = global avifauna analyses; isl = island endemic analyses; isl2 = seabird sensitivity analyses
Birdlife = Birdlife taxonomy; Birdtree = BirdTree taxonomy

##JetzExtinct50Trees
A list of 50 phylogenies (each of class 'avophylo' and 'phylo'), each containing all of the currently extant species (BirdTree taxonomy) and the extinct species grafted on.

##Master_phylo_spreadsheet_V17
The spreadsheet which is used within the avotrex R package to graft all extinct species onto
the BirdTree phylogenies. Also supplied as a data object within the package.
Grafting codes are located in the Type column, and code information is provided in the Supp info.

Id_sps = The extinct species ID.
phylo_id2 = The phylo ID. This is used for the grafting order. 
per_fixed = logical value stating whether or not a species should be grafted at a fixed point along a branch rather than random.
time_fixed = time point (in Myrs) for grafting specific species at specific time points on the tree.
Group = Either NA, or the group the extinct species is placed within. Species within groups are then randomised before grafting. 
species = Species name. Format requires an underscore to separate the genus and the species name. 
Genus = Genus
Family = Family
Order = Order 
Jetz_Order = Order following the BirdTree taxonomy. Format is all capitilised. 
Jetz_Family = Family following the BirdTree taxonomy
Jetz_Genus = Genus following the BirdTree taxonomy
Type = The type of join required for the extinct species. See table below for details on each code.
Sister_order = Either NA, or the name of the sister order(s) that the extinct species needs to be joined to or placed within.
Sister_clade = Either NA, or the name of the sister clade(s) that the extinct species needs to be joined to or placed within.
Sister_family = Either NA, or the name of the sister family(s) that the extinct species needs to be joined to or placed within.
Sister_genus = Either NA, or the name of the sister genus or genera that the extinct species needs to be joined to or placed within.
Sister_species = Either NA, or the name of the sister species that the extinct species needs to be joined to. Genus must also be supplied. 
Sister_species_group = Either NA, or the names of multiple sister species that the extinct species needs to be randomly grafted to. Species must be separated with a semi-colon,
and the genus and species name (for an individual species) must be separated with an underscore.
